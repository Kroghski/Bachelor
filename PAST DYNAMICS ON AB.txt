PAST DYNAMICS ON AB
This was done at a B_scaling = 0.25.
This was where the phase across the crystal was seen.
Interesting vectors include [530, 543] and [551, 552, 554].
In the comparison file this final group of states have phases equal to those of [7, 5, 6]

The new is at B_scaling = 0.925.
Here Bott index = 2 has been seen.
