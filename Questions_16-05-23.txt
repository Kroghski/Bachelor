How mauch in gap for blt - they seem to only appear on fringe of gap?


Excitation in article 1. Does "we excite a single site of..." mean we just localise a particle to a site.
As imagining many atoms bound and taking one atom from which we excited one electron?


In "AB_BLT_search_different_flux_0.69_interest" does the pictured gap consider one or two gaps. Question being if this is what we want when searching for BLT states.
Hypothesis: BLT states cannot have great delta E like ES has - as the latter is always found in clear gaps.
