Appears to be that in the steep is only edge states for the E/state plot, expanding slightly includes bulk states.
Current limits was 1.5 as low and 2.175 as high.
How much so be included?


Prob form:
" I will then study the dynamics starting from initial states that have overlap with the topological states. "
Overlap with topological states? How should the initial state be constructed then? Simply linear combinations of eigenvectors with probability density in the same general area of the quasicrystal?
